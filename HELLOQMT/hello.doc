Important Notice
================

In order to run HELLO.EXE you have to copy the file printq.dll from the \PRINTQ
directory to a path that is included in the LIBPATH statement in your 
CONFIG.SYS file (e. g. \OS2\DLL).

Printing in Hello queue/2 1.2 takes longer than in the other sample programs
because the print thread is suspended for one second after each line is printed
to give you enought time to abort the job. 
